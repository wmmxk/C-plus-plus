1. compile the c code:
   gcc -o hello hello.c


2. Look into the binary and learn about sections:
   objdump -s hello

   .text is the program's actual code (binary assembly code)
   .rodata is where some read-only data is stored (in this case, our string "Hello Xiaokang!")
   .interp is the filename of the dynamic linker

3. Look at some assembly
   objdump -d ./hello
