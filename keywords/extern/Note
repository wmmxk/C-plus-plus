Variables declared inside a function are called local variables as they have block scope. They are created at the point of definition and destroyed when the block is exited. Variables declared outside of a function 
are called global variables. 

A static global variable has a file scope and an extern global variable has a program scope


In addition to scope and duration, variables have a third property: linkage.

If extern linkage property is involved, there shoud be a line related to this in all the files related to this extern variables. So extern keyword is used in two ways: to declare a variable in one file; forward declare the variable (no initizliation) in another file.


By default, non-const variables declared outside of a function are assumed to be external. However, const variables declared outside of a function are assumed to be internal.
