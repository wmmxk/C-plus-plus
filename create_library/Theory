Linking: the process of looking up functions from libraries. It can happen either just after we compile the program ("static linking") or when we run the program ("dynamic linking").



Archive files (.a)
  Libraries meant to be embeded into executables during the Linking step

Shared objects files (.so)

  Libraries meant to be loaded when the exectuable starts running
